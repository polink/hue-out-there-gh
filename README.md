### Usage Notes and Examples
* As a user, from my computer, I can access all of my hue lights and change the hue light settings from one centralized place.
* As a user, I can login to my profile so that my settings are easily accessible.
* As a user, I can change settings so that my hue lights can have on-the-fly changes done to them.
* As a user, I can set up pre-made scenes so that I can manipulate groups of lights at any time.
* As a developer, I can test to see what lights are connected so that I know how many lights my code can affect.
* As a developer, I can test to see if I login successfully so that I can test if my hashing and authorization is running correctly.
* As a developer, I can hash the userâ€™s data so that they are protected from malicious software.
* As a developer, I can have modular functions so that my code is not repetitive and is clean when it comes to being read by another developer.
* As a developer, I can log errors so that I know of any potential bugs or edge cases.

#### Tests
